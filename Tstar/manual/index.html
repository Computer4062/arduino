		<p class="intro"><strong>TSTAR is a portable table clock</strong> that comes with a special functionality that allows it to manage day to day tasks</p>
		<p class="intro"><strong>This is a great equipement to keep on your table top as it acts as a nice piece of decoration</strong> ,but it also</p>
		<p class="intro">has some other special use cases:</p>
		<ul id="tips">
			<li>It is the perfect equipement if you are going on a camping trip and you want to create a scheduel</li>
			<li>The old fashened look of a physical task manager would make it even reliable for that kind of tasks</li>
			<li>If compiled into a box it is easy to carry arround making it great for outdoor trips</li>
			<li>With a physical task manager device like this one you can inform about new tasks to not only your self but to every one with you</li>
			<li>With a task manager app in a phone you can only inform yourself and this is specially true if you have no internet connectivity</li>
			<li>Where there is less access to a reliable source of electricity a battery powered device like this becomes useful</li>
			<li>This is simple to use(once you get familiar with the controls), there is no unwantedly complicated features</li>
			<li>The battery charge retainment qualities of a physical task manager are much greater than that of a phone</li>
			<li>It works with a RTC module which is way better at time keeping than a phone is</li>
			<li>This also comes into good use in a house hold</li>
			<li>Like when you have some household tasks to complete and you are sharing them with others in the house</li>
			<li>That is all personal things but can it be used in a professional environment</li>
			<li>For small groups working on projects it can be usefull to announce break times and so on</li>
